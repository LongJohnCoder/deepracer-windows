# Deepracer Windows
This repo provides some instructions on training deepracer locally on Windows. It's based on the amazing work the deepracer community has done, especially the [deepracer](https://github.com/aws-deepracer-community/deepracer) by Chirs and [deepracer-for-dummies](https://github.com/aws-deepracer-community/deepracer-for-dummies).
